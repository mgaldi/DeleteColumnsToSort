### Functions
The function `minDeletionSize` returns the indices of the unsorted columns.

### Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n*m)` where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is their length.


The space complexity is `O(1)' since no auxiliary data structure is used but only index variables.
